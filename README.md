# SwapStation - Client Side

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

### About

SwapStation is an e-commerce system for gamers who want to avoid the unnecessary expenses for the same game experience (if they don’t want to buy games on retail prices).

Gamers (members) can create accounts and upload their original discs, browse other gamers’ listings and send trade offers each other.

Besides that, they also can buy and sell products on the portal, but the main goal is the swap (pay for the shipping only).
